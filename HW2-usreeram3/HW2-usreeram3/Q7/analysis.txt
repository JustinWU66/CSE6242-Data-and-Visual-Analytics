
1. Ease to develop (for developers)
    a. Python: Pre - defined libraries require less intensive coding to visualize data.
    b. Tableau: Easy to build dashboards with drag and drop facility. Can work with data from different data sources.
    c. D3: It is difficult due to intensive coding and tedious data processing
    
2. Ease to maintain the visualization (for developers)
    a. Python: Built in visualization libraries and visualization techniques help in building  insightful visualization easily.
    b. Tableau dashboards update in real time
    c. D3: Difficult to maintain if code is unstructured and without comments. Migrating from one version to another takes effort.

3. Usability of visualization developed (for end users)
    All 3 are highly usable and can do a good job of displaying visualizations.
    - Python is good for static and scientific visualizations
    - Tableau could help in building dashboards for business analytics while 
    - D3 creates highly dynamic and customized visualization for thr web. 

   The first 2 can be used for explorative visualization, whereas D3 needs a ready plan in mind.

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
    a. Python: It requires external tools (Hadoop, AWS) to scale effeciently.
    b. Tableau: Have built-in data/web server features for scalability.
    c. D3: It needs web frameowrk to scale effectively.
   
5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing)(for end users)
    a. Python: Browser or OS
    b. Tableau: Licensed software or web browser(Tableau Public)
    c. D3: Browser

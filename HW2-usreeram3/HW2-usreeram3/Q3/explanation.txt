They use a linear function (y = m * x + b) to interpolate across the domain and range.

The scaleSqrt scale is a special case of the power scale (where k = 0.5) and is useful for sizing circles by area (rather than radius)

Log scales interpolate using a log function (y = m * log(x) + b) and can be useful when the data has an exponential nature to it.
